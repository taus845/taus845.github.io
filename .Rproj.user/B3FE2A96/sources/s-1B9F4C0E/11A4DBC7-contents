I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Department of Data Science, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Karnataka, India. My research focuses on stochastic modelling of  time-to-event and time series data with applications in survival analysis, actuarial studies and income (poverty) anlaysis. 

I received my PhD in Statistics from [Cochin University](http://stats.cusat.ac.in/) in 2019. My recent research works have been published in peer-reviewed journals and  acknowledged at several national and international conferences.
