abstract: In this paper we study some characteristic properties of higher degree bivariate stop-loss transforms (partial moments). A new bivariate distribution is proposed by extending the characterizing identity of univariate partial moments due to Lin (2003) to the bivariate case. A real-data analysis is also carried out to illustrate the theoretical results.
